(* questions to ask
 * 1. Where are we connecting to the database (in main? or in db?)
 * 2. What should https requests that don't return json's return i.e verify
      * credentials and check period
   * 3. how do we want to represent datetime (rn it's a YYYMMDD integer so that
      * we can easily compare the current date to the one in the DB)
      ****how do we get current datetime from system
  *)
